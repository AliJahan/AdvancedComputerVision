# Advanced Computer Vision

This repository contains my solutions for Advanced Computer Vision (EE243) course homeworks/projects offered by [Prof. Amit K. Roy-Chowdhury](https://vcg.engr.ucr.edu/amit), University of California, Riverside, Spring 2019.

## Directories

Each homework directory contains:
- ```problem``` directory: includes the definition of the problem, independent reading files, and template code files.
- ```solution``` directory: includes a _report_ pdf file as well as the solution _implementation_ (if asked by the problem definition).
